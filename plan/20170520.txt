Plan update:

we need to add text to the boxes for the different sorts, a heading

we need to plan the transition from sort choice to the actual 
visualization (3 states exist currently to determine which one is chosen)

A good way to start the visualizations is by using background first
A processing thread said: "Function background() is the common procedure to clear whole canvas!"
