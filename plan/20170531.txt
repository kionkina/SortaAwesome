Plan update for 2017-05-31:
Priority #1:
  -Finish Bubble Sort small scale visualization
  -Begin linking the visualizations to the main selection screen
	-Rectangle Class can be shared for all Large Scale Visualizations
	-All of the rArr classes need to be combined into one, with a separate "draw" class
	("draw" classes means that they will not be actually called draw but will retain 
	functionality)
	-Functionality from the driver classes for each of the Large Scale sorts need to be 
	moved to SA.pde
	-Rectangle class for small scale visualization needs to be renamed
	-Use of the <Name>SortSmall classes needs to be made accessible to SA.pde

Priority #2 (Additional Functionality other than MVP): 
  -Begin working on the other sorts (starting from Merge Sort)
  
Previous Goals We Have Accomplished So Far:
  -Home Screen appearance almost ideal
  -Each button on home screen changes color to indicate hovering over
  -Clicking on a button changes the state
  -Bubble Sort Large Scale Visualization is finished
  -Selection Sort Large Scale Visualization is finished
  -Selection Sort Small Scale Visualization is finished
  -Insertion Sort Large Scale Visualization is finished
  -Insertion Sort Small Scale Visualization is finished
